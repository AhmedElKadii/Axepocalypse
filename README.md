![cricket tscn - Axepocalypse - Godot Engine - Godot 002948](https://github.com/AhmedElKadii/Axepocalypse/assets/166130877/a2570be6-aa37-4478-92c3-35f86ca35fc5)<br/>

This project was a port of a game the client had made in Unity and had wanted to be ported to Godot; it covers 8 Game Modes as of writing this, the premise of the game is there's a projector projecting the game on a wooden board, and the players throw axes to determine where the input will be, the fun comes with the fact that you can miss your shot and throw the game if you're not skilled enough! 

You can see the moeds down below:

## Main Menu:

This mode has 3 difficulties:-<br/>
Easy:<br/>
![Axepocalypse (DEBUG) - Godot 002971](https://github.com/AhmedElKadii/Axepocalypse/assets/166130877/156d79ad-83dd-44b5-b2d8-c9f24f8216fa)<br/>
And it's the least challenging difficulty, all targets are stationary.<br/>

Medium:<br/>
![Axepocalypse (DEBUG) - Godot 002972](https://github.com/AhmedElKadii/Axepocalypse/assets/166130877/f0b7cfa1-4921-4397-b4c7-05e8ef667cbb)<br/>
Where the targets move after each *round* but the bullseye is stationary.<br/>

Hard:<br/>
![Axepocalypse (DEBUG) - Godot 002973](https://github.com/AhmedElKadii/Axepocalypse/assets/166130877/da7d2899-5f05-44f2-85e3-14540fe26c6b)<br/>
